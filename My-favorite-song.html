<h1>This is my Song</h1>
<div class="p">
<p>Lord we stand in the midst of a multitude<br>
Of those from every tribe and tongue
We are Your people redeemed by Your blood
Rescued from death by Your love
There are no words
Good enough to thank You
There are no words to express my praise
But I will lift up my voice
And sing from my heart
With all of my strength
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
To the Lamb
Hallelujah hallelujah
By the blood of Christ we stand
Every tongue every tribe
Every people every land
Giving glory giving honor
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God
Lord we stand by grace in Your presence
We cleansed by the blood of the Lamb
We are Your children called by Your name
Humbly we bow and we pray
Release Your power
To work in us and through us
Till we are changed
To be more like You
Then all the nations will see
Your glory revealed
And worship You
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
To the Lamb
Hallelujah hallelujah
By the blood of Christ we stand
Every tongue every tribe
Every people every land
Giving glory giving honor
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
That You are Lord of all
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
To the Lamb
Hallelujah hallelujah
By the blood of Christ we stand
Every tongue every tribe
Every people every land
Giving glory giving honor
Giving praise unto the Lamb
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
To the Lamb
Hallelujah hallelujah
By the blood of Christ we stand
Every tongue every tribe
Every people every land
Giving glory giving honor
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God
Jesus Christ Lamb of God.
